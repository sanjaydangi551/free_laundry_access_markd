            Free Laundry Access charity provides individuals and famililies who are experiencing financial challenges
            living in Canada with access to clean laundry in self-service laundromats.

            Our charity’s origins began during the pandemic when Nancy Seto, owner of Yummi Café Laundromat, witnessed
            the financial struggles her customers were experiencing, and their need to have access to clean laundry
            services. As our world returns to normal, post-pandemic, the need for Free Laundry Access is greater than
            ever. There are still great social and economic disparities, especially now with significant government
            budget cuts, reduction in social services, and the soaring cost of living such as food, housing, and
            medication.

            <br/><br/>
            Free Laundry Access helps those who are experiencing financial challenges1 by covering the full cost of
            laundering in a self-service laundromat with the;

            · Cost of wash and dry

            · Laundry detergent and dryer sheets

            <br /><br/>

            We partner with laundromats in major cities across Canada to deliver the service on site and in person.

            To spread the word about this much needed program we work with grass-root community groups, governments, and
            charitable organizations.

            Our staff will be on-site at each event to ensure the program runs smoothly and to provide support to those
            in need with the use of the machines and having their clothes cleaned properly.

            Your donation will help continue this program, allow us to expand our program offering, and continue to make
            a positive impact on the lives of individuals and families in communities across Canada.
